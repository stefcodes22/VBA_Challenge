# VBA_Challenge
This VBA challenge provides a large set of data for different stocks in the market divided by year. I have writte a code to track the different kind of stocks defined by their ticker, the change in the value (with color diferrentation for win/loss), the percent change, and the total volume of stocks. Text for the code and visuals attached.
